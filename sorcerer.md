# Sorcerer
The Initiates of the Schools of High Sorcery are held in both awe and fear by the peoples of the Sheltered Sea. Their power to shape reality and call upon the powers of the Outer Void are unrivalled, and considered by some to be a curse. The Schools rarely allow their members to be Exiled, and so they are few in number among the Guard. Those that are Exiled kindle a burning resentment of their peers in the south, and have forged a tight-knit brotherhood.
