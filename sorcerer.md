# Sorcerer
The Initiates of the Schools of High Sorcery are held in both awe and fear by the peoples of the Sheltered Sea. Their power to shape reality and call upon the powers of the Outer Void are unrivalled, and considered by some to be a curse. The Schools rarely allow their members to be Exiled, and so they are few in number among the Guard. Those that are Exiled kindle a burning resentment of their peers in the south, and have forged a tight-knit brotherhood.

## Sorcerer Moves
**High Sorcery**: You wield the power of the Outer Void with voice, thought, and gesture to change The World That Is to reflect The World As You Wish It To Be. When you wield power in this way Pay the Cost, roll *+Void* and cast a Spell that you know.
On a Success you cast the Spell,  
On a Weak Success you cast the Spell but mark 1 Corruption,  
On a Failure you mark 1 Corruption and lose 1d on your next roll.

**Minor Sorcery**: Minor sorceries are the small spells that budding Sorcerers learn. The effects of these are quite limited and utilitarian such as heating a small kettle or cup of water, starting a small fire on something easily flammable, creating a small ball of light that provides illumination as a lantern, creating a sound up to the volume of a loud shout, etc. When you use Minor Sorcery roll *+Void*.  
On a Success you cast the minor spell,  
On a  Weak Success you cast the spell and mark 1 Corruption,  
On a Failure mark 1 Corruption.
