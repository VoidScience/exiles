# Wardens of the Demon-Haunted Wastes
You are a Sorcerer stalking the Demon-Haunted Wastes of the North, scouring the land clean of demons, demonspawn, and their atrocious Hives.

You are an Exile. Sent to the mountain fortress of The Watch for your crimes in the Southern kingdoms. Too dangerous to remain in the south, too valuable to not exploit your abilities in the north.

You are an Outcast. Unwanted in the Enclave

You are a Warden. Sworn to The Watch, bound by Rite to serve. Capable of standing guard on the borders of Humanity.


# Background
Exiles come from all walks of life in the Southlands. Roll or choose from the table below, or create something new using these as inspiration:


# Reason for Exile
You committed a heinous crime or angered those in power. And for that reason you have been exiled to the frigid passes of the north. Roll, choose, or make something up:

| d6 | Reason for Exile |
| -- | ---------------- |
| 1 | Political Malcontent |
| 2 | Social Deviancy |
| 3 | Murder |
| 4 | Crimes Against Capital |
| 5 | Treason |
| 6 | Petty Theft |

# Your Archetype
The Exiles who make up The Guard fall into a select group of roles.

# Attributes

## General Attributes 
**Gnosis**
**Prowess**
**Wits**

## Endurance and Resolve 
## Corruption and Humanity
Measures the stain on your soul from using sorcery or exposure to the dark powers of the world. Your Corruption score starts at 0. When a character's Corruption Score is greater than their Resolve they become Unbalanced and lose 1d on all Wits or Savvy Tests. When their Corruption Score equals their maximum Resolve they fall Unconscious and must immediately make a roll on the Corruptions Table.

# Resolving Actions
When the Fiction triggers a Move, you determine success or failure with a simple dice pool roll. You roll a number of d6s based on the Move you have triggered, the relevant Attribute, and any bonuses or penalties that come from Traits, Equipment, or the fictional situation. Dice that show a 6 are a Success, those with a 5 are a Weak Success, and those with a 1 are a Bane.

If you roll one or more 6s, you succeed on the action without harm or complication. If you roll no 6s, but roll 1 or more 5s, you score a weak success. You get a lesser version of what you wanted, or what you wanted but at a cost. If you rolled no 5s or 6s you did not succeed on your action and suffer the Consequences.

If you rolled more than one 6, additional 6s can be spent to achieve greater success, to aid another, or to cancel Banes. Banes can be spent by the GM to introduce Consequences and Complications.

## Opposed Rolls

## Extra Successes

# Moves
Characters have Ranks in Moves, which determines the size of their Dice Pool when a Move is triggered.  Moves may also allow you to add a number of dice to the Pool based on a specified Attribute or other factor. 


# Advancing Your Character
Adding a Rank in a Move costs 2x the new Rank:

| Rank | XP Cost |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 10 |

Each Rank must be purchased in order.

# Rules
## Rolling Dice
When the fiction warrants, construct a Dice Pool based on your ranks in the triggered Move, the appropriate Attribute, and any dice added or removed based on Equipment, Difficulty, or Circumstances. Roll the Dice, 6s count as Successes while 1s count as Banes.

### Multiple Successes
While only a single success is needed on a roll, multiple successes can be used for increased effect. A non-exhaustive list of suggestions:
- Mighty Blow: Increase damage by 1,  
- Cancel a Bane,  
- Quick: You complete your task quicker than normal,
- Quiet: You complete your task without drawing notice,  
- Influential: Your speech sways additional people to your cause,  
- Extra Information: You gain additional insight into the situation

### Pushing Your Luck
If you fail your roll, or want to attempt a better outcome, you can **Push Your Luck** to roll again. You can re-roll any dice that don't show a Bane (1) and can re-roll as many or as few dice as you wish. Once you make the new roll, no new rolls are possible and you must keep this final result. After you Push Your Luck, lose Endurance or Resolve equal to the number of Banes, depending on whether you rolled with *+Brawn/Agility* or *+Wits/Savvy*. If this would knock you unconscious or make you roll on the Wounds or Panic table, do so after resolving your action.

### Difficulty
Some tasks are more or less difficult than normal, and may add or remove dice to or from a Pool accordingly.

## Combat

### Armor

### Weapons

## Corruptions Table

## Rest
