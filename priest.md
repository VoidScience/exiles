# Priest
Priests serve the gods of the Thousand Temples, the collected deities of Humanity. But you are no mere Acolyte, you have been blessed by the gods to go into the world and wield power in their name. It is uncommon to find one initiated into the ranks of the Priesthood exiled to the Guard, those that do are in high demand for their healing abilities.

## Priest Moves
**Blessings**: You can work the blessing magic of the Thousand Cults. When you wield the power of a god in this way roll *+Savvy*

**Healing**: When you channel the power of the gods to heal another roll *+Savvy*. If you instead rely on herbs and the skilled work of your hands roll *+Wits*
