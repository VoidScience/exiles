# Exiles of the Wastelands
It has been centuries since Cultists of the Great Dark cracked open the Gates of Night, letting Demons swarm into the Mundane World from the Outer Void. The Northern Realms fell, overrun by the Demonic Horde. A slow and inexorable retreat southwards finally led to them being stopped at the Shield Mountains. The Northlands became a devastated wasteland. Infested with demonspawn and dark monstrosities.

You are an Exile, sent to join the Mountain Guard as punishment for your 'crimes'. To hold back the demonspawn. To safeguard the remaining realms of Humanity. To find what honor you can in the cold and the dark.

# Background

# Your Role
The Exiles who make up The Guard fall into a select group of roles.

[**The Warden**](warden.md)  
[**The Champion**](champion.md)  
[**The Priest**](priest.md)  
[**The Sorcerer**](sorcerer.md)  
[**The Delver**](delver.md)
[**The Sapper**](sapper.md)
[**The Shapechanger**](shapechanger.md)
[**The Scholar**](scholar.md)

# Attributes
Your Exile's base attributes each have a rank from 1 to 5. Your rank indicates the number of d6s you add to your Dice Pool when you roll *+Attribute*. The Attributes are:

**Hard**: When you engage in violence or the threat of violence without pity or remorse
**Savvy**: When you rely on your wits, knowledge, or social skill
**Fate**: When it is up to the Fates to decide what shall be
**Void**: When you call on the Powers of the Outer Void

## Endurance, Resolve, and Corruption
**Endurance**: Reflects your physical reserves of energy, and is drained by physical attacks or adverse events.  When your Endurance reaches 0 you fall Unconscious and must immediately make a roll on the Wounds table.

**Resolve**: Reflects your mental and spiritual stamina. Resolve can be drained by social adversity, magical attacks, or other circumstances. When your Resolve reaches zero you must immediately make a roll on the Panic Table.

**Corruption**: Measures the stain on your soul from using sorcery or exposure to the dark powers of the world. Your Corruption score starts at 0. When a character's Corruption Score is greater than their Resolve they become Unbalanced and lose 1d on all Wits or Savvy Tests. When their Corruption Score equals their maximum Resolve they fall Unconscious and must immediately make a roll on the Corruptions Table.

# Resolving Actions
When the Fiction triggers a Move, you determine success or failure with a simple dice pool roll. You roll a number of d6s based on the Move you have triggered, the relevant Attribute, and any bonuses or penalties that come from Traits, Equipment, or the fictional situation. Dice that show a 6 are a Success, those with a 5 are a Weak Success, and those with a 1 are a Bane.

If you roll one or more 6s, you succeed on the action without harm or complication. If you roll no 6s, but roll 1 or more 5s, you score a weak success. You get a lesser version of what you wanted, or what you wanted but at a cost. If you rolled no 5s or 6s you did not succeed on your action and suffer the Consequences.

If you rolled more than one 6, additional 6s can be spent to achieve greater success, to aid another, or to cancel Banes. Banes can be spent by the GM to introduce Consequences and Complications.

## Combat Moves
Almost all Combat Moves are used as Opposed Rolls between two combatants. Some, such as Close Quarters and Exchange Fire are done where both parties use the same Move. In others, the two opponents may be using mismatched Moves such as Snipe versus Take Fire. You can only inflict damage if the Move states that as an outcome. In Opposed Rolls 6s eliminate each other from the two opponents results, followed by 5s. If one side has more 6s than the other, that side achieves the Success. If all 6s have been eliminated from both parties, the side with the greater number of 5s wins with a Weak Success. Otherwise both sides Fail and take damage.

Each Rank must be purchased in order.

# Rules
## Rolling Dice
When the fiction warrants, construct a Dice Pool based on your ranks in the triggered Move, the appropriate Attribute, and any dice added or removed based on Equipment, Difficulty, or Circumstances. Roll the Dice, 6s count as Successes while 1s count as Banes.

### Multiple Successes
While only a single success is needed on a roll, multiple successes can be used for increased effect. A non-exhaustive list of suggestions:
- Mighty Blow: Increase damage by 1,  
- Quick: You complete your task quicker than normal,
- Quiet: You complete your task without drawing notice,  
- Influential: Your speech sways additional people to your cause,  
- Extra Information: You gain additional insight into the situation

### Pushing Your Luck
If you fail your roll, or want to attempt a better outcome, you can **Push Your Luck** to roll again. You can re-roll any dice that don't show a Bane (1) and can re-roll as many or as few dice as you wish. Once you make the new roll, no new rolls are possible and you must keep this final result. After you Push Your Luck, lose Endurance or Resolve equal to the number of Banes, depending on whether you rolled with *+Brawn/Agility* or *+Wits/Savvy*. If this would knock you unconscious or make you roll on the Wounds or Panic table, do so after resolving your action.

### Difficulty
Some tasks are more or less difficult than normal, and may add or remove dice to or from a Pool accordingly.

### Armor

### Weapons

## Wounds Table

## Panic Table

## Corruptions Table
