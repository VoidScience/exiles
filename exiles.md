# Exiles of the Wastelands
It has been centuries since Cultists of the Great Dark cracked open the Gates of Night, letting Demons swarm into the Mundane World from the Outer Void. The Northern Realms fell, overrun by the Demonic Horde. A slow and inexorable retreat southwards finally led to them being stopped at the Shield Mountains. The Northlands became a devastated wasteland. Infested with demonspawn and dark monstrosities.

You are an Exile, sent to join the Mountain Guard as punishment for your 'crimes'. To hold back the demonspawn. To safeguard the remaining realms of Humanity. To find what honor you can in the cold and the dark.
