# Champion
Champions are the masters of weapons and warfare. Perhaps you have trained since you were a child to become a Knight of a noble House or maybe you were raised in the fighting pits of the Capital city, either way you have trained extensively in the use of weapons, armor, and violent action.

## Champion Moves
**Weapons Master**: This move replaced the Melee and Ranged Moves for you, as you are equally skilled. When you attack in Melee roll *+Brawn*, when you attack in Ranged roll *+Agility*.

**Bodyguard**: If someone within Short range of you is hit by an attack, you can dive in to take the hit. It doesnâ€™t count as an action in combat. Roll *+Agility*, if you roll one or more successes, you take the hit instead of your friend. You can push the roll.
