# Champion
Champions are elite warriors with a broad range of experience in weapons and warfare. Perhaps you have trained since you were a child to become a Knight of a noble House or maybe you were raised in the fighting pits of the Capital city, either way you have trained extensively in the use of weapons, armor, and violent action.

## Champion Moves
**Combat Training**: This move replaces the Melee and Ranged General Moves for you, as you are equally well trained in both. Also, if your Endurance falls to zero roll *+Brawn*. If you are successful you gain 1d6 Endurance and do not fall unconscious. You do however still roll on the Wound Table.

**Guard Space**: When you want to defend another from attack or stand your ground to block the way roll *+Brawn*. If successful any attacks on an individual you are guarding are redirected to you instead (to defend against normally). If guarding a space, you prevent any opposition from entering or moving through that space.

## Special Traits
**Favoured Weapon**: Name a weapon type (sword, axe, spear, bow, etc). This is your favoured weapon. You have +2d when wielding a weapon of this type.
