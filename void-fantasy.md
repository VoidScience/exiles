# Exiles of the Wastelands
It has been centuries since the cultists of the Great Darkness cracked open the Gates of Oblivion, allowing Demons from the Outer Void to swarm into The Mundane World. The Northern Realms fell, entirely overrun by the Demonic Horde before being finally checked at the mountains of the Shield Range. Humanity retreated, the passes fortified and guarded.

You are a Ranger of the Mountain Guards. You hold the Passes against Demonic incursion, and venture north, into The Wastelands to hunt the enemy there. A long running war of attrition.

You are an Exile, for few choose this life. You have been cast out from the Southlands to live out your life here, to eke out what glory you can in the grim cold and dark.

# Your Character

## Attributes
You have 4 Attributes: **Brawn**, **Agility**, **Wits**, and **Savvy**. Attributes have a rating between 1 and 5:

**Brawn**: Raw muscle power, physical strength, and general hardiness  
**Agility**: Speed, flexibility, reflexes, reaction time, and precision  
**Wits**: Quick thinking, sensory perception, and reasoning  
**Savvy**: Social skills, relatability, and charisma

Roll on the following table or chose for your Attributes:

| # | Brawn | Agility | Wits | Savvy |
| - | ----- | ------- | ---- | ----- |
| 1 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 |
| 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 3 |
| 6 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 |

### Pools
**Endurance**: Reflects your physical reserves of energy, and is drained by physical attacks or adverse events. Your starting Endurance is equal to the average of your Brawn and Agility, plus 1. When your Endurance reaches 0 you fall Unconscious and must immediately make a roll on the Wounds table.

**Resolve**: Reflects your mental and spiritual stamina. Resolve can be drained by social adversity, magical attacks, or other circumstances. When your Resolve reaches zero you must immediately make a roll on the Panic Table.

### Corruption
Characters typically start with a Corruption Score of 0. Character's gain Corruption when they are exposed to Dark Sorcery, call upon Dark Forces, or fail when working Sorcery. When a character's Corruption Score is greater than their Resolve they become Unbalanced and lose 1d on all Wits or Savvy Tests. When their Corruption Score equals their maximum Resolve they fall Unconscious and must immediately make a roll on the Corruptions Table.

## General Moves
All Ranger's start with 1 Rank in each of the following General Moves:

**Risk Danger**: When you undertake a dangerous task:
- If you tackle it with brute strength or endurance roll *+Brawn*
- If you tackle it with speed, grace, or flexibility roll *+Agility*
- If you think your way through the problem roll *+Wits*
- If you talk your way through it roll *+Savvy*  

**Converse with Intent**: When you try and persuade, intimidate, or trick another using your words roll *+Savvy*.

**Search**: When you look for clues, search for traps, seek to discover hidden things, or otherwise physically look for something roll *+Wits*

**Melee**: When you are in physical combat, armed or unarmed, roll *+Brawn*

**Ranged**: When you engage in ranged combat, whether shot or thrown, roll *+Agility*

## Professional Skills
Not every Ranger is cut from the same cloth, and different Ranger's bring different backgrounds and skills to their duties in the north. Choose a Profession for your Ranger. Each Profession comes with a set of unique abilities and Moves. You have a starting Rank of 2 in all Profession Moves

### Warden
Wardens are the Ranger's most at home in the Wilderness. They specialize in long-range patrols through the Wastelands, hunting down Demons and other malign creatures.

#### Warden Moves
**Find Safe Haven**: Roll *+Wits*. On a Success you are able to find a refuge in the Wilderness suitable for proper Rest.

**Versed in the Ways of the Enemy**: When you attempt to track, determine strategy, or recall information related to the Demon-spawn and Dark Monstrosities of the Wastelands roll *+Wits*.

### Champion
Champions are the masters of weapons and warfare. Perhaps you have trained since you were a child to become a Knight of a noble House or maybe you were raised in the fighting pits of the Capital city, either way you have trained extensively in the use of weapons, armor, and violent action.

#### Champion Moves
**Weapons Master**: This move replaced the Melee and Ranged Moves for you, as you are equally skilled. When you attack in Melee roll *+Brawn*, when you attack in Ranged roll *+Agility*.

**Bodyguard**: If someone within Short range of you is hit by an attack, you can dive in to take the hit. It doesn’t count as an action in combat. Roll *+Agility*, if you roll one or more successes, you take the hit instead of your friend. You can push the roll.

### Priest
Priests serve the gods of the Thousand Temples, the collected deities of Humanity. But you are no mere Acolyte, you have been blessed by the gods to go into the world and wield power in their name. It is uncommon to find one initiated into the ranks of the Priesthood exiled to the Guard, those that do are in high demand for their healing abilities.

#### Priest Moves
**Blessings**: You can work the blessing magic of the Thousand Cults. When you wield the power of a god in this way roll *+Savvy*

**Healing**: When you channel the power of the gods to heal another roll *+Savvy*. If you instead rely on herbs and the skilled work of your hands roll *+Wits*

### Sorcerer
The Initiates of the Schools of High Sorcery are held in both awe and fear by the peoples of the Sheltered Sea. Their power to shape reality and call upon the powers of the Outer Void are unrivalled, and considered by some to be a curse. The Schools rarely allow their members to be Exiled, and so they are few in number among the Guard. Those that are Exiled kindle a burning resentment of their peers in the south, and have forged a tight-knit brotherhood.

#### Sorcerer Moves
**Sorcery**: When you apply Thought and Word to reshape Reality to fit your Will roll *+Wits*.

**Master of Metaphysics**: When you deal with intelligent Demons or other Entities of the Outer Void roll *+Savvy*. When you seek to perceive things beyond mere mortal sight roll *+Wits*

### Delver
Where the Warden is most at home in the Wilderness and traversing the Wasteland in pursuit of their Demon-spawned Prey, the Delver is most at home in the ruins of the ancient Northern Realms. Tombs, deep dungeons, ruined cities, and the lost places of the world are their specialty.

#### Delver Moves
**Dungeoneer**: When you explore old ruins, search for hidden entrances, or disarm ancient traps roll *+Wits*

**Scrounge**: When you look for something useful among the ruins of the fallen world roll *+Wits*

# Rules
## Rolling Dice
When the fiction warrants, construct a Dice Pool based on your ranks in the triggered Move, the appropriate Attribute, and any dice added or removed based on Equipment, Difficulty, or Circumstances. Roll the Dice, 6s count as Successes while 1s count as Banes.

### Multiple Successes
If you roll two or more successes, you reach your stated goal, but also gain some additional bonus effect, depending on the situation and the skill used. In combat, extra successes can increase the damage done. For other skills, you can suggest a bonus effect yourself. The GM has final say. Some suggestions:  
✦ You act quickly.  
✦ You act quietly.  
✦ You help another character.  
✦ You impress someone.  
✦ You discover something unexpected.

**MORE SUCCESSES**: Rolling three or even more successes generally only matters in combat, where each additional will increase the damage done by one point.

### Pushing Your Roll
Your initial skill roll reflects a safe and controlled action. If you fail your initial roll, or if you want additional successes, you can lean into the action, giving it everything you’ve got, pushing yourself to the limit.  

This is called pushing the roll, and lets you re-roll any dice that don’t show the result of 1. A base die showing a 1 is called a bane and can never be re-rolled when pushing. After a push, you cannot change back to the previous result. All dice count after the push, even any dice you didn’t re-roll.

**Cost of Pushing**: After a pushed roll, you immediately lose 1 point of Endurance (if you rolled for Brawn or Agility) or one point of Resolve (if you rolled for Wits or Savvy) for each bane (1) rolled on your base dice. If this damage or stress breaks you, this happens after the action is resolved.

### Difficulty Modifiers

## Combat

### Armor
Body armor can protect you from damage. Armor doesn’t provide protection from other kinds of damage, or from damage you inflict on yourself when you push a roll. The effect of armor is determined by its armor rating. When you suffer damage from a physical attack, roll a number of base dice equal to the armor rating (dice pool) Every success you roll decreases the damage by one. This roll does not count as an action and cannot be pushed.

If any damage penetrates your armor, its armor rating is decreased – every bane you rolled reduces the armor rating by one step. If the armor absorbs all the damage, any banes rolled have no effect. Armor can be repaired by using the Craft skill.

## Panic Table
