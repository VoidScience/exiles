# Your Character

## Attributes
You have 4 Attributes: **Brawn**, **Agility**, **Wits**, and **Savvy**. Attributes have a rating between 1 and 5:

**Brawn**: Raw muscle power, physical strength, and general hardiness  
**Agility**: Speed, flexibility, reflexes, reaction time, and precision  
**Wits**: Quick thinking, sensory perception, and reasoning  
**Savvy**: Social skills, relatability, and charisma

Roll on the following table or chose for your Attributes:

| # | Brawn | Agility | Wits | Savvy |
| - | ----- | ------- | ---- | ----- |
| 1 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 |

| 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 3 |
| 6 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 |

**Endurance**: Reflects your physical reserves of energy, and is drained by physical attacks or adverse events. Your starting Endurance is equal to the average of your Brawn and Agility, plus 1. When your Endurance reaches 0 you fall Unconscious and must immediately make a roll on the Wounds table.

**Resolve**: Reflects your mental and spiritual stamina. Resolve can be drained by social adversity, magical attacks, or other circumstances. When your Resolve reaches zero you must immediately make a roll on the Panic Table.
